The problem statement
The aim of building a machine learning model is to solve a problem and to define a metric to measure model performance.

The problem is to model and investigate the linear relationship between Sales and Advertising dataset for a dietary weight control product.

I have used two performance metrics RMSE (Root Mean Square Value) and R2 Score value to compute our model performance.

About the dataset
The data set has been imported from the econometrics website with the following url:-
http://www.econometrics.com/intro/sales.htm

This data set contains Sales and Advertising expenditures for a dietary weight control product. It contains monthly data for 36 months. The variables in this data set are Sales and Advertising.

# Import the data

url = "C:/project_datasets/SALES.txt"
df = pd.read_csv(url, sep='\t', header=None)
Exploratory data analysis
First, I import the dataset into the dataframe with the standard read_csv () function of pandas library and assign it to the df variable. Then, I conducted exploratory data analysis to get a feel for the data.

pandas shape attribute
The shape attribute of the pandas dataframe gives the dimensions of the dataframe.

Independent and Dependent Variables
In this project, I refer Independent variable as Feature variable and Dependent variable as Target variable. These variables are also recognized by different names as follows: -

Independent variable
Independent variable is also called Input variable and is denoted by X. In practical applications, independent variable is also called Feature variable or Predictor variable. We can denote it as:-

Independent or Input variable (X) = Feature variable = Predictor variable

Dependent variable
Dependent variable is also called Output variable and is denoted by y.

Dependent variable is also called Target variable or Response variable. It can be denoted it as follows:-

Dependent or Output variable (y) = Target variable = Response variable

# Declare feature variable and target variable

X = df['Sales'].values
y = df['Advertising'].values

# Sales and Advertising data values are given by X and y respectively.

# Values attribute of pandas dataframe returns the numpy arrays.
Visual exploratory data analysis
I visualize the relationship between X and y by plotting a scatterplot between X and y.

# Plot scatter plot between X and y

plt.scatter(X, y, color = 'blue', label='Scatter Plot')
plt.title('Relationship between Sales and Advertising')
plt.xlabel('Sales')
plt.ylabel('Advertising')
plt.legend(loc=4)
plt.show()

Checking dimensions of X and y
We need to check the dimensions of X and y to make sure they are in right format for Scikit-Learn API.

It is an important precursor to model building.

# Print the dimensions of X and y

print(X.shape)
print(y.shape)
(36,)
(36,)
Reshaping X and y
Since we are working with only one feature variable, so we need to reshape using Numpy reshape() method.

It specifies first dimension to be -1, which means "unspecified".

Its value is inferred from the length of the array and the remaining dimensions.

# Reshape X and y

X = X.reshape(-1,1)
y = y.reshape(-1,1)
# Print the dimensions of X and y after reshaping

print(X.shape)
print(y.shape)
(36, 1)
(36, 1)
Difference in dimensions of X and y after reshaping
We can see the difference in diminsions of X and y before and after reshaping.

It is essential in this case because getting the feature and target variable right is an important precursor to model building.

Train test split
I split the dataset into two sets namely - train set and test set.

The model learn the relationships from the training data and predict on test data.

# Split X and y into training and test data sets

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
# Print the dimensions of X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test

print(X_train.shape)
print(y_train.shape)
print(X_test.shape)
print(y_test.shape)
(24, 1)
(24, 1)
(12, 1)
(12, 1)
Mechanics of the model
I split the dataset into two sets – the training set and the test set. Then, I instantiate the regressor lm and fit it on the training set with the fit method.

In this step, the model learned the relationships between the training data (X_train, y_train).

Now the model is ready to make predictions on the test data (X_test). Hence, I predict on the test data using the predict method.

# Fit the linear model

# Instantiate the linear regression object lm
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
lm = LinearRegression()


# Train the model using training data sets
lm.fit(X_train,y_train)


# Predict on the test data
y_pred=lm.predict(X_test)
Model slope and intercept term
The model slope is given by lm.coef_ and model intercept term is given by lm.intercept_.

The estimated model slope and intercept values are 1.60509347 and -11.16003616.

So, the equation of the fitted regression line is

y = 1.60509347 * x - 11.16003616

# Compute model slope and intercept

a = lm.coef_
b = lm.intercept_,
print("Estimated model slope, a:" , a)
print("Estimated model intercept, b:" , b) 
Estimated model slope, a: [[1.60509347]]
Estimated model intercept, b: (array([-11.16003616]),)
# So, our fitted regression line is 

# y = 1.60509347 * x - 11.16003616 

# That is our linear model.
Making predictions
I have predicted the Advertising values on first five 5 Sales datasets by writing code

	lm.predict(X) [0:5]  


If I remove [0:5], then I will get predicted Advertising values for the whole Sales dataset.

To make prediction, on an individual Sales value, I write

	lm.predict(Xi)


where Xi is the Sales data value of the ith observation.

# Predicting Advertising values

lm.predict(X)[0:5]

# Predicting Advertising values on first five Sales values.
array([[ 8.10108551],
       [21.74438002],
       [22.54692675],
       [13.71891266],
       [13.39789396]])
# To make an individual prediction using the linear regression model.

print(str(lm.predict(24)))
[[27.36220717]]
Regression metrics for model performance
Now, it is the time to evaluate model performance.

For regression problems, there are two ways to compute the model performance. They are RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-Squared Value. These are explained below:-

RMSE
RMSE is the standard deviation of the residuals. So, RMSE gives us the standard deviation of the unexplained variance by the model. It can be calculated by taking square root of Mean Squared Error. RMSE is an absolute measure of fit. It gives us how spread the residuals are, given by the standard deviation of the residuals. The more concentrated the data is around the regression line, the lower the residuals and hence lower the standard deviation of residuals. It results in lower values of RMSE. So, lower values of RMSE indicate better fit of data.

# Calculate and print Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
print("RMSE value: {:.4f}".format(rmse))
RMSE value: 11.2273
R2 Score
R2 Score is another metric to evaluate performance of a regression model. It is also called coefficient of determination. It gives us an idea of goodness of fit for the linear regression models. It indicates the percentage of variance that is explained by the model.

Mathematically,

R2 Score = Explained Variation/Total Variation

In general, the higher the R2 Score value, the better the model fits the data. Usually, its value ranges from 0 to 1. So, we want its value to be as close to 1. Its value can become negative if our model is wrong.

# Calculate and print r2_score

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
print ("R2 Score value: {:.4f}".format(r2_score(y_test, y_pred)))
R2 Score value: 0.5789
Interpretation and Conclusion
The RMSE value has been found to be 11.2273. It means the standard deviation for our prediction is 11.2273. So, sometimes we expect the predictions to be off by more than 11.2273 and other times we expect less than 11.2273. So, the model is not good fit to the data.

In business decisions, the benchmark for the R2 score value is 0.7. It means if R2 score value >= 0.7, then the model is good enough to deploy on unseen data whereas if R2 score value < 0.7, then the model is not good enough to deploy. Our R2 score value has been found to be .5789. It means that this model explains 57.89 % of the variance in our dependent variable. So, the R2 score value confirms that the model is not good enough to deploy because it does not provide good fit to the data.

# Plot the Regression Line


plt.scatter(X, y, color = 'blue', label='Scatter Plot')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color = 'black', linewidth=3, label = 'Regression Line')
plt.title('Relationship between Sales and Advertising')
plt.xlabel('Sales')
plt.ylabel('Advertising')
plt.legend(loc=4)
plt.show()

Residual analysis
A linear regression model may not represent the data appropriately. The model may be a poor fit to the data. So, we should validate our model by defining and examining residual plots.

The difference between the observed value of the dependent variable (y) and the predicted value (ŷi) is called the residual and is denoted by e. The scatter-plot of these residuals is called residual plot.

If the data points in a residual plot are randomly dispersed around horizontal axis and an approximate zero residual mean, a linear regression model may be appropriate for the data. Otherwise a non-linear model may be more appropriate.

If we take a look at the generated ‘Residual errors’ plot, we can clearly see that the train data plot pattern is non-random. Same is the case with the test data plot pattern. So, it suggests a better-fit for a non-linear model.

# Plotting residual errors

plt.scatter(lm.predict(X_train), lm.predict(X_train) - y_train, color = 'red', label = 'Train data')
plt.scatter(lm.predict(X_test), lm.predict(X_test) - y_test, color = 'blue', label = 'Test data')
plt.hlines(xmin = 0, xmax = 50, y = 0, linewidth = 3)
plt.title('Residual errors')
plt.legend(loc = 4)
plt.show()

Checking for Overfitting and Underfitting
I calculate training set score as 0.2861. Similarly, I calculate test set score as 0.5789. The training set score is very poor. So, the model does not learn the relationships appropriately from the training data. Thus, the model performs poorly on the training data. It is a clear sign of Underfitting. Hence, I validated my finding that the linear regression model does not provide good fit to the data.

Underfitting means our model performs poorly on the training data. It means the model does not capture the relationships between the training data. This problem can be improved by increasing model complexity. We should use more powerful models like Polynomial regression to increase model complexity.

# Checking for Overfitting or Underfitting the data

print("Training set score: {:.4f}".format(lm.score(X_train,y_train)))

print("Test set score: {:.4f}".format(lm.score(X_test,y_test)))
Training set score: 0.2861
Test set score: 0.5789
# Save model for future use

from sklearn.externals import joblib
joblib.dump(lm, 'lm_regressor.pkl')

# To load the model

# lm2=joblib.load('lm_regressor.pkl')
